# SW2 Sync: SW2 recruitment software website integrations

This is a project aimed at providing synchronisation between Jobs on a local Rails application and those provided by a remote XML feed from SW2 software.

This is a work in progress, so there are no guarantees!

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. I'll decide whether I want to include it.
